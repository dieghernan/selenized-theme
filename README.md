Dark and light syntax themes with green accents inspired by
[Selenized](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized/tree/master) by Jan WarchoÅ‚.

**Selenized** is a redesign of [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/),
featuring:

-   Higher contrast and improved lightness, thanks to fine-tuned color palettes.
-   Consistent accent colors.
-   A focus on readability.
-   Four theme options:
    -   Dark variants:
        -   Black Theme
        -   Dark Theme
    -   Light variants:
        -   Light Theme
        -   White Theme
